   - Description: This Tableau workbook features a visually compelling map that displays average flight delays based on the origin and destination airports for 
     both arrivals and departures. The interactive dashboard allows users to select specific airports, providing insights into the average delays associated with 
     these selections. 

     Additionally, a Sankey chart is included, illustrating the relationship between airlines and the number of cancelled flights, categorized by month. This 
     visual representation facilitates the analysis of the cancellation percentages for each airline, offering insights into both the individual and overall impact 
     of cancellations on flights for each respective month in the year 2015. The Sankey chart utilizes sigmoid curves to visually depict the connections between 
     the source (months) and target (airlines) components, enabling a comprehensive understanding of cancellation trends over the specified time period.
